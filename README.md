## Technologies Used
I added bootstrap to add some css to my project.
I used chart.js for the chart.
I also utilized the google maps api to retrieve book information.
I added websocket and redis for real time updates as well.

## General Approach
I first worked on the general layout of the app. Then worked on the MVC in that order (model, view, controller). I then made sure the form was functional. Once the form worked, I went ahead and worked on the graph. I then worked on the map. I then made some layout and styling changes. I then installed websocket and redis for real time updates.

## Unsolved Problems And Hurdles
1. One of the biggest hurdles I had was pushing the website to heroku. Heroku just does not like me! It took me several tries and several fixes. I am able to see real time updates when running the server on my computer, but not able to see them on Heroku yet. I am still working this part!
